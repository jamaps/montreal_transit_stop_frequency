### Map of transit stop frequency in Montreal

http://jamaps.github.io/montreal_transit_stop_frequency/

This map was built with GTFS data available from STM:
http://www.stm.info/en/about/developers

The frequency for each stop is pulled from GTFS data via a python script that loops over the stops.txt and stop_times.txt files.

The points were displayed on the map using Mapbox GL. The basemap was designed using Mapbox Studio and with OpenStreetMap data.
